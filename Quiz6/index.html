    (Just long sentence.) Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit
    impediemts. <span class="inline-block-span">Love</span> is not love Whhich
    alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O,
    no! it is an ever-fix`ed mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
    It is the star to every wand'ring bark, Whose worth's unkown, although his
    heighth be taken. <span class="inline-block-span">Love's</span> not Time's
    fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass
    come; <span class="inline-block-span">Love</span> alters not with his
    brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom: If this
    be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
